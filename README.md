This project implements the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic substitution cipher where each letter in a text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts user-input text.
- Includes a slider to select the shift range (from 0 to 25).
- Real-time update of the encrypted text.
- A modern, minimalist design inspired by terminal aesthetics.

## Technologies Used
